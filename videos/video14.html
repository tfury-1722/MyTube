        Having a vision for oneself and committing to excellence is significant.
        Clarity in thinking and having clear goals is important along with
        constantly moving forward and not playing it safe. Overcome the fear of
        failure and develop courage by confronting fears and mastering them.
        Courage, persistence, and self-confidence are essential. Success
        patterns build upon each other leading to future success.
