        Acknowledging and noticing our thoughts and reactions is important. Shifting negative thoughts to positive ones can have a significant impact on our lives. Distractions can pull us away from being present with ourselves. True connection requires taking a moment to breathe and feel without judgment or interpretation. Believing stories that haven't yet happened can hold us back. Prioritizing self-connection and mindfulness to navigate distractions could help to find inner peace.
