        Commitment is the key to seeing dreams, hopes, and goals come to
        fruition. It is a superpower that can change your life. Achieving goals
        can be difficult and require a lot of effort and time and many give up
        along the way. But the one difference is between a loser and a winner is
        the winner was the loser who never quitted.
